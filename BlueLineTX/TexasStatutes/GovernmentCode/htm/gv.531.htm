The office shall give notice to the provider of the time and place of the second informal resolution meeting not later than the 20th day before the date the meeting is to be held.  A provider must have an opportunity to provide additional information before the second informal resolution meeting for consideration by the office.  A provider's decision to seek an informal resolution under this subdivision does not extend the time by which the provider must request an expedited administrative hearing under Subdivision (3).  However, a hearing initiated under Subdivision (3) shall be stayed until the informal resolution process is completed.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  The office shall, in consultation with the state's Medicaid fraud control unit, establish guidelines under which payment holds or program exclusions:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  may permissively be imposed on a provider; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  shall automatically be imposed on a provider.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  In addition to performing functions and duties otherwise provided by law, the office may:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  assess administrative penalties otherwise authorized by law on behalf of the commission or a health and human services agency;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  request that the attorney general obtain an injunction to prevent a person from disposing of an asset identified by the office as potentially subject to recovery by the office due to the person's fraud or abuse;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  provide for coordination between the office and special investigative units formed by managed care organizations under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=531.113&amp;Date=6/26/2014">531.113</a> or entities with which managed care organizations contract under that section;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  audit the use and effectiveness of state or federal funds, including contract and grant funds, administered by a person or state agency receiving the funds from a health and human services agency;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  conduct investigations relating to the funds described by Subdivision (4);  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  recommend policies promoting economical and efficient administration of the funds described by Subdivision (4) and the prevention and detection of fraud and abuse in administration of those funds.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a reference in law or rule to the commission's office of investigations and enforcement means the office of inspector general established under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The office shall prepare a final report on each audit or investigation conducted under this section.
