(a)  The comptroller shall conduct a study using comparable sales and generally accepted auditing and sampling techniques to determine the total taxable value of all property in each school district. The study shall determine the taxable value of all property and of each category of property in the district and the productivity value of all land that qualifies for appraisal on the basis of its productive capacity and for which the owner has applied for and received a productivity appraisal.  The comptroller shall make appropriate adjustments in the study to account for actions taken under Chapter 41, Education Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-1)  The comptroller shall conduct a study:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  at least every two years in each school district for which the most recent study resulted in a determination by the comptroller that the school district's local value was valid; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  each year in a school district for which the most recent study resulted in a determination by the comptroller that the school district's local value was not valid.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-2)  If in any year the comptroller does not conduct a study, the school district's local value for that year is considered to be valid.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  In conducting the study, the comptroller shall determine the taxable value of property in each school district:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  using, if appropriate, samples selected through generally accepted sampling techniques;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  according to generally accepted standard valuation, statistical compilation, and analysis techniques;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  ensuring that different levels of appraisal on sold and unsold property do not adversely affect the accuracy of the study; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  ensuring that different levels of appraisal resulting from protests determined under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=41.43&amp;Date=6/26/2014">41.43</a>, Tax Code, are appropriately adjusted in the study.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  If after conducting the study the comptroller determines that the local value for a school district is valid, the local value is presumed to represent taxable value for the school district.  In the absence of that presumption, taxable value for a school district is the state value for the school district determined by the comptroller under Subsections (a) and (b) unless the local value exceeds the state value, in which case the taxable value for the school district is the district's local value.  In determining whether the local value for a school district is valid, the comptroller shall use a margin of error that does not exceed five percent unless the comptroller determines that the size of the sample of properties necessary to make the determination makes the use of such a margin of error not feasible, in which case the comptroller may use a larger margin of error.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c-1)  This subsection applies only to a school district whose central administrative office is located in a county with a population of 9,000 or less and a total area of more than 6,000 square miles.
