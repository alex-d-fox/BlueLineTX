MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR REGULATED ENTITIES ELECTRONICALLY CONDUCTING BUSINESS WITH CONSUMERS.  (a)  Subject to Subsection (c), a notice to a party or other written communication with a party required in an insurance transaction or that is to serve as evidence of insurance coverage may be delivered, stored, and presented by electronic means only if the delivery, storage, or presentment complies with Chapter 322, Business &amp; Commerce Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Delivery of a written communication in compliance with this section is equivalent to any delivery method required by law, including delivery by first class mail, first class mail, postage prepaid, or certified mail.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  A written communication may be delivered by electronic means to a party by a regulated entity under this section if:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the party affirmatively consented to delivery by electronic means and has not withdrawn the consent;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the party, before giving consent, is provided with a clear and conspicuous statement informing the party of:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  any right or option the party may have for the written communication to be provided or made available in paper or another nonelectronic form;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the right of the party to withdraw consent under this section and any conditions or consequences imposed if consent is withdrawn;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  whether the party's consent applies:</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(i)  only to a specific transaction for which the written communication must be given; or</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(ii)  to identified categories of written communications that may be delivered by electronic means during the course of the relationship between the party and the regulated entity;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(D)  the means, after consent is given, by which a party may obtain a paper copy of a written communication delivered by electronic means; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(E)  the procedure a party must follow to:</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(i)  withdraw consent under this section; and</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(ii)  update information needed for the regulated entity to contact the party electronically; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the party:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  before giving consent, is provided with a statement identifying the hardware and software requirements for the party's access to and retention of a written communication delivered by electronic means; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  consents electronically or confirms consent electronically in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the party can access a written communication in the electronic form used to deliver the communication.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  After consent of the party is given, in the event a change in the hardware or software requirements to access or retain a written communication delivered by electronic means creates a material risk that the party may not be able to access or retain a subsequent written communication to which the consent applies, the regulated entity shall:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  provide the party with a statement:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  identifying the revised hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of a written communication delivered by electronic means; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  disclosing the right of the party to withdraw consent without the imposition of any condition or consequence that was not disclosed under Subsection (c)(2)(B); and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  comply with Subsection (c)(3).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  This section does not affect requirements for content or timing of any required written communication.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  If a written communication provided to a party expressly requires verification or acknowledgment of receipt, the written communication may be delivered by electronic means only if the method used provides for verification or acknowledgment of receipt.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of any contract or policy of insurance executed by a party may not be denied solely due to the failure to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent of the party in accordance with Subsection (c)(3)(B).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  A withdrawal of consent by a party does not affect the legal effectiveness, validity, or enforceability of a written communication delivered by electronic means to the party before the withdrawal of consent is effective.  A withdrawal of consent is effective within a reasonable period of time after the date of the receipt by the regulated entity of the withdrawal.  Failure by a regulated entity to comply with Subsection (d) may be treated by the party as a withdrawal of consent.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If the consent of a party to receive a written communication by electronic means is on file with a regulated entity before September 1, 2013, and if the entity intends to deliver to the party written communications under this section, then before the entity may deliver by electronic means additional written communications, the entity must notify the party of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the written communications that may be delivered by electronic means that were not previously delivered by electronic means; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the party's right to withdraw consent to have written communications delivered by electronic means.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Except as otherwise provided by law, an oral communication or a recording of an oral communication may not qualify as a written communication delivered by electronic means for purposes of this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  If a signature on a written communication is required by law to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the notary public or other authorized person and the other required information are attached to or logically associated with the signature or written communication.</p>
