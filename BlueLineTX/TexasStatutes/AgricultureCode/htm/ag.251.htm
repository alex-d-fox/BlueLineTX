(a)  For purposes of this section, the effective date of a governmental requirement is the date on which the requirement requires or attempts to require compliance as to the geographic area encompassed by the agricultural operation.  The recodification of a municipal ordinance does not change the original effective date to the extent of the original requirements.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  A governmental requirement of a political subdivision of the state other than a city:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  applies to an agricultural operation with an established date of operation subsequent to the effective date of the requirement;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  does not apply to an agricultural operation with an established date of operation prior to the effective date of the requirement;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  applies to an agricultural operation if the governmental requirement was in effect and was applicable to the operation prior to the effective date of this chapter.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  A governmental requirement of a city does not apply to any agricultural operation situated outside the corporate boundaries of the city on the effective date of this chapter.
