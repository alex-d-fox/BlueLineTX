The commission shall give preference to:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  stations providing both liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas at a single location;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  stations located not more than one mile from an interstate highway system; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  stations located in the triangular area between the Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas-Fort Worth areas.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  To meet the goals of this section, the commission may solicit grant applications under this section for a new fueling station in a specific area or location.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Grants made under this section are not subject to the requirements of Sections <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=394.002&amp;Date=6/28/2014">394.002</a> through <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=394.008&amp;Date=6/28/2014">394.008</a>.

This subsection does not create a cause of action to contest an application or award of a grant.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The commission, in consultation with the natural gas industry, shall determine the most efficient use of funding for the station grants under this section to maximize the availability of natural gas fueling stations.</p>
