The continuum of services includes facilities operated by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and community services provided by the department and other entities through contracts with the department.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  It is the goal of this state to provide a comprehensive range of services for persons with mental illness or mental retardation who need publicly supported care, treatment, or habilitation.  In providing those services, efforts will be made to coordinate services and programs with services and programs provided by other governmental entities to minimize duplication and to share with other governmental entities in financing those services and programs.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  It is the policy of this state that, when appropriate and feasible, persons with mental illness or mental retardation shall be afforded treatment in their own communities.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  It is the public policy of this state that mental health and mental retardation services be the responsibility of local agencies and organizations to the greatest extent possible.  The department shall assist the local agencies and organizations by coordinating the implementation of a statewide system of services.  The department shall ensure that mental health and mental retardation services are provided.  The department shall provide technical assistance for and regulation of the programs that receive funding through contracts with the department.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  It is the public policy of this state to offer services first to those persons who are most in need.  Therefore, funds appropriated by the legislature for mental health and mental retardation services may be spent only to provide services to the priority populations identified in the department's long-range plan.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  It is the goal of this state to establish at least one special officer for mental health assignment in each county.  To achieve this goal, the department shall assist a local law enforcement agency that desires to have an officer certified under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&amp;Value=1701.404&amp;Date=6/28/2014">1701.404</a>, Occupations Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  It is the policy of this state that the board serves as the state's mental health and mental retardation authority and is responsible for the planning, policy development, and resource development and allocation for and oversight of mental health and mental retardation services in this state.  It is the policy of this state that, when appropriate and feasible, the board may delegate the board's authority to a single entity in each region of the state that may function as the local mental health or mental retardation authority for one or more service areas in the region.</p>
