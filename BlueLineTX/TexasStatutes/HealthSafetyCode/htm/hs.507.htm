(a)  Not later than the 30th day after the date an order finding that a violation has occurred is issued, the director shall inform the facility operator against whom the order is issued of the amount of the penalty for the violation.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Except as provided by Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=HS&amp;Value=507.010&amp;Date=6/28/2014">507.010</a>(e), within 30 days after the date the director's order is final as provided by Subchapter F, Chapter 2001, Government Code, the facility operator shall:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  pay the amount of the penalty;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  pay the amount of the penalty and file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  without paying the amount of the penalty, file a petition for judicial review contesting the occurrence of the violation, the amount of the penalty, or both the occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Within the 30-day period, a facility operator who acts under Subsection (b)(3) may:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  stay enforcement of the penalty by:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  paying the amount of the penalty to the court for placement in an escrow account;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  giving to the court a supersedeas bond that is approved by the court for the amount of the penalty and that is effective until all judicial review of the director's order is final;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  request the court to stay enforcement of the penalty by:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  filing with the court a sworn affidavit of the facility operator stating that the facility operator is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and is financially unable to give the supersedeas bond;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  giving a copy of the affidavit to the executive director by certified mail.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  If the director receives a copy of an affidavit under Subsection (c)(2), the director may file with the court, within five days after the date the copy is received, a contest to the affidavit.  The court shall hold a hearing on the facts alleged in the affidavit as soon as practicable and shall stay the enforcement of the penalty on finding that the alleged facts are true.  The facility operator who files an affidavit has the burden of proving that the facility operator is financially unable to pay the amount of the penalty and to give a supersedeas bond.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  If the facility operator does not pay the amount of the penalty and the enforcement of the penalty is not stayed, the director may refer the matter to the attorney general for collection of the amount of the penalty.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Judicial review of the order of the director:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  is instituted by filing a petition as provided by Subchapter G, Chapter 2001, Government Code;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  is under the substantial evidence rule.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  If the court sustains the occurrence of the violation, the court may uphold or reduce the amount of the penalty and order the facility operator to pay the full or reduced amount of the penalty.  If the court does not sustain the occurrence of the violation, the court shall order that no penalty is owed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  When the judgment of the court becomes final, the court shall proceed under this subsection.  If the facility operator paid the amount of the penalty and if that amount is reduced or is not upheld by the court, the court shall order that the appropriate amount plus accrued interest be remitted to the facility operator.  The rate of the interest is the rate charged on loans to depository institutions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the interest shall be paid for the period beginning on the date the penalty was paid and ending on the date the penalty is remitted.  If the facility operator gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is not upheld by the court, the court shall order the release of the bond.  If the facility operator gave a supersedeas bond and if the amount of the penalty is reduced, the court shall order the release of the bond after the facility operator pays the amount.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  All proceedings under this section are subject to Chapter 2001, Government Code.</p>
