The State of Texas recognizes the personal hardships and economic distress caused by flood disasters since it has become uneconomic for the private insurance industry alone to make flood insurance available to those in need of such protection on reasonable terms and conditions.  Recognizing the burden of the nation's resources, congress enacted the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. Sections 4001 through 4127), whereby flood insurance can be made available through coordinated efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry, by pooling risks, and the positive cooperation of state and local government.  The purpose of this subchapter is to evidence a positive interest in securing flood insurance coverage under this federal program and to so procure for those citizens of Texas desiring to participate and in promoting the public interest by providing appropriate protection against the perils of flood losses and in encouraging sound land use by minimizing exposure of property to flood losses.</p>

At a minimum, the methodology and guidance must include:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a method of calculating total water use by a municipality or water utility, including water billed and nonrevenue water used, and a method of calculating water use for each sector of water users served by a municipality or water utility;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a method of calculating total water use by a municipality or water utility in gallons per capita per day;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a method of classifying water users within sectors;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  a method of calculating water use in the residential sector that includes both single-family and multifamily residences, in gallons per capita per day;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  a method of calculating water use in the industrial, agricultural, commercial, and institutional sectors that is not dependent on a municipality's population or the number of customers served by a water utility; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  guidelines on the use of service populations by a municipality or water utility in developing a per-capita-based method of calculation, including guidance on the use of permanent and temporary populations in making calculations.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The board or the commission, as appropriate, shall use the methodology and guidance developed under Subsection (b) in evaluating a water conservation plan, program of water conservation, survey, or other report relating to water conservation submitted to the board or the commission under:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=11.1271&amp;Date=6/28/2014">11.1271</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=13.146&amp;Date=6/28/2014">13.146</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=15.106&amp;Date=6/28/2014">15.106</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=15.607&amp;Date=6/28/2014">15.607</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=15.975&amp;Date=6/28/2014">15.975</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=15.995&amp;Date=6/28/2014">15.995</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=16.012&amp;Date=6/28/2014">16.012</a>(m);</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(8)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=16.402&amp;Date=6/28/2014">16.402</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(9)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=17.125&amp;Date=6/28/2014">17.125</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(10)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=17.277&amp;Date=6/28/2014">17.277</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(11)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=17.857&amp;Date=6/28/2014">17.857</a>; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(12)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=WA&amp;Value=17.927&amp;Date=6/28/2014">17.927</a>.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The board, in consultation with the commission and the Water Conservation Advisory Council, shall develop a data collection and reporting program for municipalities and water utilities with more than 3,300 connections.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Not later than January 1 of each odd-numbered year, the board shall submit to the legislature a report that includes the most recent data relating to:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  statewide water usage in the residential, industrial, agricultural, commercial, and institutional sectors; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the data collection and reporting program developed under Subsection (d).</p>
