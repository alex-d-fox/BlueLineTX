(a)  Following the final conviction of a person for possession of a gambling device or equipment, altered gambling equipment, or gambling paraphernalia, for an offense involving a criminal instrument, for an offense involving an obscene device or material, for an offense involving child pornography, or for an offense involving a scanning device or re-encoder, the court entering the judgment of conviction shall order that the machine, device, gambling equipment or gambling paraphernalia, instrument, obscene device or material, child pornography, or scanning device or re-encoder be destroyed or forfeited to the state.  Not later than the 30th day after the final conviction of a person for an offense involving a prohibited weapon, the court entering the judgment of conviction on its own motion, on the motion of the prosecuting attorney in the case, or on the motion of the law enforcement agency initiating the complaint on notice to the prosecuting attorney in the case if the prosecutor fails to move for the order shall order that the prohibited weapon be destroyed or forfeited to the law enforcement agency that initiated the complaint.  If the court fails to enter the order within the time required by this subsection, any magistrate in the county in which the offense occurred may enter the order.  Following the final conviction of a person for an offense involving dog fighting, the court entering the judgment of conviction shall order that any dog-fighting equipment be destroyed or forfeited to the state.  Destruction of dogs, if necessary, must be carried out by a veterinarian licensed in this state or, if one is not available, by trained personnel of a humane society or an animal shelter.  If forfeited, the court shall order the contraband delivered to the state, any political subdivision of the state, or to any state institution or agency.  If gambling proceeds were seized, the court shall order them forfeited to the state and shall transmit them to the grand jury of the county in which they were seized for use in investigating alleged violations of the Penal Code, or to the state, any political subdivision of the state, or to any state institution or agency.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  If there is no prosecution or conviction following seizure, the magistrate to whom the return was made shall notify in writing the person found in possession of the alleged gambling device or equipment, altered gambling equipment or gambling paraphernalia, gambling proceeds, prohibited weapon, obscene device or material, child pornography, scanning device or re-encoder, criminal instrument, or dog-fighting equipment to show cause why the property seized should not be destroyed or the proceeds forfeited.  The magistrate, on the motion of the law enforcement agency seizing a prohibited weapon, shall order the weapon destroyed or forfeited to the law enforcement agency seizing the weapon, unless a person shows cause as to why the prohibited weapon should not be destroyed or forfeited.

The motion must contain an affidavit or sworn statement stating:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  that the applicant is a subscriber or customer of the provider of an electronic communications service or the provider of a remote computing service from which the electronic customer data held in electronic storage for the subscriber or customer has been sought; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the applicant's reasons for believing that the customer data sought is not relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this article in some other respect.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  The subscriber or customer shall give written notice to the provider of an electronic communications service or the provider of a remote computing service of the challenge to the subpoena or court order.

The court may conduct any additional proceedings the court considers appropriate if the court is unable to make a determination on the motion on the basis of the parties' initial allegations and response.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  The court shall rule on the motion as soon after the filing of the officer's response as practicable.  The court shall deny the motion if the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber or customer whose electronic customer data held in electronic storage is the subject of the subpoena or court order or that there is reason to believe that the peace officer's inquiry is legitimate and that the customer data sought is relevant to that inquiry.  The court shall quash the subpoena or vacate the order if the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber or customer whose data is the subject of the subpoena or court order and that there is not a reason to believe that the data is relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of this article.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  A court order denying a motion or application under this section is not a final order and no interlocutory appeal may be taken from the denial.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 7.
