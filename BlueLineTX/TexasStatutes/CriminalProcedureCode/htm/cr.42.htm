If the court does not order restitution or orders partial restitution under this subsection, the court shall state on the record the reasons for not making the order or for the limited order.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)(1) If the offense results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense, the court may order the defendant:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  to return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  if return of the property is impossible or impractical or is an inadequate remedy, to pay an amount equal to the greater of:</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(i)  the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or</p><p style="text-indent:25ex;" class="left">(ii)  the value of the property on the date of sentencing, less the value of any part of the property that is returned on the date the property is returned.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  If the offense results in personal injury to a victim, the court may order the defendant to make restitution to:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the victim for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the compensation to victims of crime fund to the extent that fund has paid compensation to or on behalf of the victim.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  If the victim or the victim's estate consents, the court may, in addition to an order under Subdivision (2), order the defendant to make restitution by performing services instead of by paying money or make restitution to a person or organization, other than the compensation to victims of crime fund, designated by the victim or the estate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The court, in determining whether to order restitution and the amount of restitution, shall consider:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the amount of the loss sustained by any victim and the amount paid to or on behalf of the victim by the compensation to victims of crime fund as a result of the offense; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)   other factors the court deems appropriate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d) If the court orders restitution under this article and the victim is deceased the court shall order the defendant to make restitution to the victim's estate.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The court shall impose an order of restitution that is as fair as possible to the victim or to the compensation to victims of crime fund, as applicable.  The imposition of the order may not unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)(1)  The court may not order restitution for a loss for which the victim has received or will receive compensation only from a source other than the compensation to victims of crime fund.  The court may, in the interest of justice, order restitution to any person who has compensated the victim for the loss to the extent the person paid compensation.  An order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or to the compensation to victims of crime fund be made before any restitution to any other person is made under the order.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  Any amount recovered by a victim from a person ordered to pay restitution in a federal or state civil proceeding is reduced by any amount previously paid to the victim by the person under an order of restitution.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)(1)  The court may require a defendant to make restitution under this article within a specified period or in specified installments.  If the court requires the defendant to make restitution in specified installments, in addition to the installment payments, the court may require the defendant to pay a one-time restitution fee of $12, $6 of which the court shall retain for costs incurred in collecting the specified installments and $6 of which the court shall order to be paid to the compensation to victims of crime fund.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  The end of the period or the last installment may not be later than:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the end of the period of probation, if probation is ordered;</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  five years after the end of the term of imprisonment imposed, if the court does not order probation; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(C)  five years after the date of sentencing in any other case.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  If the court does not provide otherwise, the defendant shall make restitution immediately.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  Except as provided by Subsection (n), the order of restitution must require the defendant to:  (i)  make restitution directly to the person or agency that will accept and forward restitution payments to the victim or other person eligible for restitution under this article, including the compensation to victims of crime fund;  (ii)  make restitution directly to the victim or other person eligible for restitution under this article, including the compensation to victims of crime fund; or (iii) deliver the amount or property due as restitution to a community supervision and corrections department for transfer to the victim or person.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  If a defendant is placed on community supervision or is paroled or released on mandatory supervision, the court or the parole panel shall order the payment of restitution ordered under this article as a condition of community supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision.  The court may revoke community supervision and the parole panel may revoke parole or mandatory supervision if the defendant fails to comply with the order.  In determining whether to revoke community supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision, the court or parole panel shall consider:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the defendant's employment status;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the defendant's current and future earning ability;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the defendant's current and future financial resources;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  any other special circumstances that may affect the defendant's ability to pay; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  the victim's financial resources or ability to pay expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  In addition to any other terms and conditions of probation imposed under Article <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=42.12&amp;Date=7/2/2014">42.12</a>, the court may require a probationer to reimburse the compensation to victims of crime fund created under Subchapter B, Chapter 56, for any amounts paid from that fund to or on behalf of a victim of the probationer's offense.

The court shall permit the defendant and the prosecuting attorney to read the report.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k) The court shall resolve any dispute relating to the proper amount or type of restitution.  The standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence.  The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense is on the prosecuting attorney.  The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant and the defendant's dependents is on the defendant.  The burden of demonstrating other matters as the court deems appropriate is on the party designated by the court as justice requires.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l) Conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to restitution under this article estops the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent federal civil proceeding or state civil proceeding brought by the victim, to the extent consistent with state law.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m) An order of restitution may be enforced by the state or a victim named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n) If a defendant is convicted of or receives deferred adjudication for an offense under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=25.05&amp;Date=7/2/2014">25.05</a>, Penal Code, if the child support order on which prosecution of the offense was based required the defendant to pay the support to a local registry or the Title IV-D agency, and if the court orders restitution under this article, the order of restitution must require the defendant to pay the child support in the following manner:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(1) during any period in which the defendant is under the supervision of a community supervision and corrections department, to the department for transfer to the local registry or Title IV-D agency designated as the place of payment in the child support order;

DEFERRED ADJUDICATION; COMMUNITY SUPERVISION.    (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (d) of this section, when in the judge's opinion the best interest of society and the defendant will be served, the judge may, after receiving a plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendere, hearing the evidence, and finding that it substantiates the defendant's guilt, defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt, and place the defendant on community supervision.  A judge may place on community supervision under this section a defendant charged with an offense under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=21.11&amp;Date=7/2/2014">21.11</a>, <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=22.011&amp;Date=7/2/2014">22.011</a>, or <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=22.021&amp;Date=7/2/2014">22.021</a>, Penal Code, regardless of the age of the victim, or a defendant charged with a felony described by Section 13B(b) of this article, only if the judge makes a finding in open court that placing the defendant on community supervision is in the best interest of the victim.  The failure of the judge to find that deferred adjudication is in the best interest of the victim is not grounds for the defendant to set aside the plea, deferred adjudication, or any subsequent conviction or sentence.  After placing the defendant on community supervision under this section, the judge shall inform the defendant orally or in writing of the possible consequences under Subsection (b) of this section of a violation of community supervision.  If the information is provided orally, the judge must record and maintain the judge's statement to the defendant.  The failure of a judge to inform a defendant of possible consequences under Subsection (b) of this section is not a ground for reversal unless the defendant shows that he was harmed by the failure of the judge to provide the information.  In a felony case, the period of community supervision may not exceed 10 years.  For a defendant charged with a felony under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=21.11&amp;Date=7/2/2014">21.11</a>, <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=22.011&amp;Date=7/2/2014">22.011</a>, or <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=22.021&amp;Date=7/2/2014">22.021</a>, Penal Code, regardless of the age of the victim, and for a defendant charged with a felony described by Section 13B(b) of this article, the period of community supervision may not be less than five years.  In a misdemeanor case, the period of community supervision may not exceed two years.  A judge may increase the maximum period of community supervision in the manner provided by Section 22(c) or 22A of this article.  The judge may impose a fine applicable to the offense and require any reasonable conditions of community supervision, including mental health treatment under Section 11(d) of this article, that a judge could impose on a defendant placed on community supervision for a conviction that was probated and suspended, including confinement.  The provisions of Section 15 of this article specifying whether a defendant convicted of a state jail felony is to be confined in a county jail or state jail felony facility and establishing the minimum and maximum terms of confinement as a condition of community supervision apply in the same manner to a defendant placed on community supervision after pleading guilty or nolo contendere to a state jail felony.  However, upon written motion of the defendant requesting final adjudication filed within 30 days after entering such plea and the deferment of adjudication, the judge shall proceed to final adjudication as in all other cases.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(a-1)  Before placing a defendant on deferred adjudication community supervision under this section, the court shall inform the defendant of the defendant's right to petition the court for an order of nondisclosure under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=411.081&amp;Date=7/2/2014">411.081</a>, Government Code, unless the defendant is ineligible to pursue that right because of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the nature of the offense for which the defendant is placed on deferred adjudication community supervision; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the defendant's criminal history.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  On violation of a condition of community supervision imposed under Subsection (a), the defendant may be arrested and detained as provided in Section 21.  The defendant is entitled to a hearing limited to the determination by the court of whether it proceeds with an adjudication of guilt on the original charge.  The court may not proceed with an adjudication of guilt on the original charge if the court finds that the only evidence supporting the alleged violation of a condition of community supervision is the uncorroborated results of a polygraph examination.  The determination to proceed with an adjudication of guilt on the original charge is reviewable in the same manner as a revocation hearing conducted under Section 21 in a case in which an adjudication of guilt had not been deferred.  After an adjudication of guilt, all proceedings, including assessment of punishment, pronouncement of sentence, granting of community supervision, and defendant's appeal continue as if the adjudication of guilt had not been deferred.  A court assessing punishment after an adjudication of guilt of a defendant charged with a state jail felony may suspend the imposition of the sentence and place the defendant on community supervision or may order the sentence to be executed, regardless of whether the defendant has previously been convicted of a felony.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  On expiration of a community supervision period imposed under Subsection (a), if the judge has not proceeded to adjudication of guilt, the judge shall dismiss the proceedings against the defendant and discharge him.  The judge may dismiss the proceedings and discharge a defendant, other than a defendant charged with an offense requiring the defendant to register as a sex offender under Chapter 62, prior to the expiration of the term of community supervision if in the judge's opinion the best interest of society and the defendant will be served.  The judge may not dismiss the proceedings and discharge a defendant charged with an offense requiring the defendant to register under Chapter 62.

For any defendant who receives a dismissal and discharge under this section:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  upon conviction of a subsequent offense, the fact that the defendant had previously received community supervision with a deferred adjudication of guilt shall be admissible before the court or jury to be considered on the issue of penalty;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  if the defendant is an applicant for a license or is a licensee under Chapter 42, Human Resources Code, the Department of Family and Protective Services may consider the fact that the defendant previously has received community supervision with a deferred adjudication of guilt under this section in issuing, renewing, denying, or revoking a license under that chapter;

The judge may extend the period of community supervision in a misdemeanor case for any period the judge determines is necessary, not to exceed an additional two years beyond the three-year limit, if the defendant fails to pay a previously assessed fine, costs, or restitution and the judge determines that extending the period of supervision increases the likelihood that the defendant will fully pay the fine, costs, or restitution.
