If any provision, section or clause of this Act or application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications hereof which can be given effect without the invalid provision, section or clause, and to this end the provisions of this Act are declared to be severable.</p>

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Article <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=CR&amp;Value=54.02&amp;Date=6/28/2014">54.02</a>, all laws relating to criminal procedure in this State that are not embraced, incorporated, or included in this Act and that have not been enacted during the Regular Session of the 59th Legislature are repealed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b) None of the following articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Texas, 1925, in force on the effective date of this Act, is repealed:  52;  52-1 through 52-161, both inclusive;  367D through 367K, both inclusive;  781B-1, 781B-2;  944 through 951, both inclusive;  1009 through 1035, both inclusive;  1037 through 1056, both inclusive;  1058 through 1064, both inclusive;  and 1075 through 1082, both inclusive.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 2.  (a)  All laws and parts of laws relating to criminal procedure omitted from this Act have been intentionally omitted, and all additions to and changes in such procedure have been intentionally made.  This Act shall be construed to be an independent Act of the Legislature, enacted under its caption, and the articles contained in this Act, as revised, rewritten, changed, combined, and codified, may not be construed as a continuation of former laws except as otherwise provided in this Act.  The existing statutes of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, and of the Penal Code of Texas, 1925, as amended, which contain special or specific provisions of criminal procedure covering specific instances are not repealed by this Act.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b) A person under recognizance or bond on the effective date of this Act continues under such recognizance or bond pending final disposition of any action pending against him.</p>

The fact that the laws relating to criminal procedure in this State have not been completely revised and re-codified in more than a century past and the further fact that the administration of justice, in the field of criminal law, has undergone changes, through judicial construction and interpretation of constitutional provisions, which have been, in certain instances, modified or nullified, as the case may be, necessitates important changes requiring the revision or modernization of the laws relating to criminal procedure, and the further fact that it is desirous and desirable to strengthen, and to conform, various provisions in such laws to current interpretation and application, emphasizes the importance of this legislation and all of which, together with the crowded condition of the calendar in both Houses, create an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the Constitutional Rule requiring bills to be read on three several days be suspended, and said Rule is hereby suspended, and that this Act shall take effect and be in force and effect from and after 12 o'clock Meridian on the 1st day of January, Anno Domini, 1966, and it is so enacted.</p>
