The department may waive this requirement only if the juvenile board demonstrates to the department that unusual, catastrophic, or exceptional circumstances existed during the relevant year to affect adversely the level of county funding.  If the required amount of local funding is not budgeted and the department does not grant a waiver, the department shall reduce the allocation of state aid funds to the juvenile board by the amount equal to the amount that the county funding is below the required funding.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  For purposes of Subsection (a), the amount spent on juvenile detention and correctional facilities is included in determining the amount of local or county funds.
