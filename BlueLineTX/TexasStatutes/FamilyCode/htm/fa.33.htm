In this chapter:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  "Abortion" means the use of any means to terminate the pregnancy of a female known by the attending physician to be pregnant, with the intention that the termination of the pregnancy by those means will with reasonable likelihood cause the death of the fetus.  This definition, as applied in this chapter, applies only to an unemancipated minor known by the attending physician to be pregnant and may not be construed to limit a minor's access to contraceptives.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  "Fetus" means an individual human organism from fertilization until birth.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  "Guardian" means a court-appointed guardian of the person of the minor.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  "Physician" means an individual licensed to practice medicine in this state.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  "Unemancipated minor" includes a minor who:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  is unmarried;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  has not had the disabilities of minority removed under Chapter 31.</p>

(a)  A physician may not perform an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor unless:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the physician performing the abortion gives at least 48 hours actual notice, in person or by telephone, of the physician's intent to perform the abortion to:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  a parent of the minor, if the minor has no managing conservator or guardian;  or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the judge of a court having probate jurisdiction, the judge of a county court at law, the judge of a district court, including a family district court, or a court of appellate jurisdiction issues an order authorizing the minor to consent to the abortion as provided by Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=33.003&amp;Date=6/28/2014">33.003</a> or <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=33.004&amp;Date=6/28/2014">33.004</a>;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a probate court, county court at law, district court, including a family district court, or court of appeals, by its inaction, constructively authorizes the minor to consent to the abortion as provided by Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=33.003&amp;Date=6/28/2014">33.003</a> or <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=FA&amp;Value=33.004&amp;Date=6/28/2014">33.004</a>;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the physician performing the abortion:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  concludes that on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, a condition exists that complicates the medical condition of the pregnant minor and necessitates the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avoid a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  certifies in writing to the Texas Department of Health and in the patient's medical record the medical indications supporting the physician's judgment that the circumstances described by Paragraph (A) exist.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  If a person to whom notice may be given under Subsection (a)(1) cannot be notified after a reasonable effort, a physician may perform an abortion if the physician gives 48 hours constructive notice, by certified mail, restricted delivery, sent to the last known address, to the person to whom notice may be given under Subsection (a)(1).  The period under this subsection begins when the notice is mailed.  If the person required to be notified is not notified within the 48-hour period, the abortion may proceed even if the notice by mail is not received.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The requirement that 48 hours actual notice be provided under this section may be waived by an affidavit of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  a parent of the minor, if the minor has no managing conservator or guardian;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a court-appointed managing conservator or guardian.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A physician may execute for inclusion in the minor's medical record an affidavit stating that, according to the best information and belief of the physician, notice or constructive notice has been provided as required by this section.  Execution of an affidavit under this subsection creates a presumption that the requirements of this section have been satisfied.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The Texas Department of Health shall prepare a form to be used for making the certification required by Subsection (a)(4).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  A certification required by Subsection (a)(4) is confidential and privileged and is not subject to disclosure under Chapter 552, Government Code, or to discovery, subpoena, or other legal process.  Personal or identifying information about the minor, including her name, address, or social security number, may not be included in a certification under Subsection (a)(4).  The physician must keep the medical records on the minor in compliance with the rules adopted by the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=OC&amp;Value=153.003&amp;Date=6/28/2014">153.003</a>, Occupations Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  A physician who intentionally performs an abortion on a pregnant unemancipated minor in violation of this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000. In this subsection, "intentionally" has the meaning assigned by Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=6.03&amp;Date=6/28/2014">6.03</a>(a), Penal Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  It is a defense to prosecution under this section that the minor falsely represented her age or identity to the physician to be at least 18 years of age by displaying an apparently valid governmental record of identification such that a reasonable person under similar circumstances would have relied on the representation.  The defense does not apply if the physician is shown to have had independent knowledge of the minor's actual age or identity or failed to use due diligence in determining the minor's age or identity.  In this subsection, "defense" has the meaning and application assigned by Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=PE&amp;Value=2.03&amp;Date=6/28/2014">2.03</a>, Penal Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  In relation to the trial of an offense under this section in which the conduct charged involves a conclusion made by the physician under Subsection (a)(4), the defendant may seek a hearing before the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners on whether the physician's conduct was necessary to avert the death of the minor or to avoid a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.  The findings of the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners under this subsection are admissible on that issue in the trial of the defendant.  Notwithstanding any other reason for a continuance provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure or other law, on motion of the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit a hearing under this subsection to take place.</p>
