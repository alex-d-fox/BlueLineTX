In apportioning the area, the court shall consider population densities, patterns of growth, transportation, topography, and land use in the municipalities and the overlapping area.  The area must be apportioned among the municipalities:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  so that each municipality's part is contiguous to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality or, if the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality is totally overlapped, is contiguous to the boundaries of the municipality;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  so that each municipality's part is in a substantially compact shape;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  in the same ratio, to one decimal, that the respective populations of the municipalities bear to each other, but with each municipality receiving at least one-tenth of the area.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  An apportionment under this section must consider existing property lines.  A tract of land or adjoining tracts of land that were under one ownership on August 23, 1963, and that do not exceed 160 acres may not be apportioned so as to be in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of more than one municipality unless the landowner gives written consent to that apportionment.</p>
