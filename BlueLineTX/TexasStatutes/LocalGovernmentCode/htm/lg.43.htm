Nothing in this subsection modifies the requirement under Subsection (g) for a service plan to provide a level of services in an annexed area that is equal or superior to the level of services provided within the corporate boundaries of the municipality before annexation.

The amount of such costs, as estimated by the district, shall be escrowed by the municipality for the benefit of the persons entitled to receive payment in an insured interest-bearing account with a financial institution authorized to do business in the state.  To compensate the developer for the municipality's use of the infrastructure facilities pending the determination of the reimbursement amount or federal preclearance, all interest accrued on the escrowed funds shall be paid to the developer whether or not the annexation is valid.  Upon placement of the funds in the escrow account, the annexation may become effective.  In the event a municipality timely escrows all estimated reimbursable amounts as required by this subsection and all such amounts, determined to be owed, including interest, are subsequently disbursed to the developer within five days of final determination in immediately available funds as required by this section, no penalties or interest shall accrue during the pendency of the escrow.

The municipality may issue refunding bonds or warrants to refund bonds, warrants, or other obligations, including unpaid earned interest on them, that is assumed by the municipality.

The municipality may combine the district system or property with the municipality's similar system or property if:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the municipality has no outstanding revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of the net revenue of its own utility system or property;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the municipality:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  has outstanding obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of net revenues sufficient to meet the outstanding obligations;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  those revenues have produced, during the five-year period before May 30, 1959, an annual surplus in an amount sufficient to meet the annual obligations for which the district revenues are pledged.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If the municipality combines the systems or property as provided by Subsection (i), it shall levy on all property subject to taxation by the municipality an annual property tax at a rate that, when combined with other available municipal funds and revenues, is sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the outstanding obligations.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  If all the area in the district becomes a part of the municipality, the municipality, unless the refunding authorized by Subsection (l) has been accomplished, shall separately operate the district and municipal systems and property and may not commingle revenue if the municipality has outstanding bonds, warrants, or other bonded obligations payable from and secured by a pledge of the net revenue of its own utility system or property and does not have an amount annually accruing to its surplus revenue fund that exceeds the amount of the fund pledged to the payment of outstanding municipal obligations and that is sufficient to meet the annual obligations for which the district revenues are pledged.  The municipality shall perform the duties and other functions imposed by law or contract on the governing body of the district relating to the district's outstanding bonds, warrants, or other obligations and shall separately perform the duties and other functions relating to the bonds, warrants, and other obligations of the municipal system.  The municipality may allocate overhead expenses between any two or more systems in direct proportion to the gross income of each system.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  The municipality may issue revenue refunding bonds in its own name for the purpose of refunding outstanding district revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations, including unpaid accrued interest on them, that are assumed by the municipality under this section.  The municipality may combine different issues of district and municipal revenue bonds, warrants, or other obligations into one series of revenue refunding bonds and may pledge the net revenues of the utility systems or property to the payment of the refunding bonds as the governing body considers proper.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, Chapter 1502, Government Code, applies to the revenue refunding bonds, but an election for the issuance of the bonds is not required.  Refunding bonds must bear interest at the same rate or at a lower rate than that borne by the refunded obligations unless it is shown mathematically that a different rate results in a savings in the total amount of interest to be paid.</p>

Subject to Subsection (f), the agreement must provide for the distribution among the municipalities of the property and other assets of the district and for the pro rata assumption by the municipalities of all the debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district.  The assumption by each municipality must be based on the ratio that the value of the property and other assets distributed to that municipality bears to the total value of all the property and other assets of the district.  The determination of value may be made on an original cost basis, a reproduction cost basis, a fair market value basis, or by any other valuation method agreed on by the parties that reasonably reflects the value of the property and other assets, debts, liabilities, and obligations of the district.

The agreement must also provide for the distribution among one or more of the municipalities of the pro rata assets and liabilities located in the unincorporated area and must provide for service to customers in unincorporated areas in the service area of the abolished district.

The system or property shall be operated in that manner until all the revenue bonds, warrants, or obligations are retired in full by payment or by the refunding of the bonds, warrants, or other obligations into municipal obligations.  The board of trustees must be composed of not more than five members appointed by the governing bodies of the municipalities.  The trustees are appointed for the terms and shall perform the duties as provided by the agreement made under Subsection (c) or (d).  The board also shall perform the duties and other functions that are imposed by law or by contract on the abolished district and its governing board and that relate to the outstanding revenue bonds.
