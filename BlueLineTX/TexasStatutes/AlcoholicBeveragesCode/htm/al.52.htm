The commission or the administrator may only issue a package store tasting permit to a holder of a package store permit or wine only package store permit.  For the purposes of this code and any other law of the state or political subdivision of the state, a package store tasting permit may not be considered a permit authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premise consumption.  Since no charge may be made for a sample tasted on the premises of a package store, none of a package store's or wine only package store's revenue may be deemed to be revenue from the on-premise sale of alcoholic beverages.</p>
