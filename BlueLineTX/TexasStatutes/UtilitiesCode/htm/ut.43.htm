GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="43.001"></a><a name="95818.84314"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 43.001.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  (a)  The legislature finds that broadband over power lines, also known as BPL, is an emerging technology platform that offers a means of providing broadband services to reach homes and businesses.  BPL services can also be used to enhance existing electric delivery systems, which can result in improved service and reliability for electric customers.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The legislature finds that access to quality, high speed broadband services is important to this state.  BPL deployment in Texas has the potential to extend broadband service to customers where broadband access is currently not available and may provide an additional option for existing broadband consumers in Texas, resulting in a more competitive market for broadband services.  The legislature further finds that BPL development in Texas is fully dependent upon the participation of electric utilities in this state that own and operate power lines and related facilities that are necessary for the construction of BPL systems and the provision of BPL services.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Consistent with the goal of increasing options for telecommunications in this state, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the deployment of BPL by permitting affiliates of the electric utility, or permitting unaffiliated entities, to own or operate all or a portion of such BPL systems.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide the appropriate framework to support the deployment of BPL.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The legislature finds that an electric utility may choose to implement BPL under the procedures set forth in this chapter, but is not required to do so.  The electric utility shall have the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether to implement BPL and may not be penalized for deciding to implement or not to implement BPL.</p>
