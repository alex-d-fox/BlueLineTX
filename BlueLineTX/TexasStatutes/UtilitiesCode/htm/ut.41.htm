In the event of such enforcement proceeding or judicial review the court may, in addition to the other remedies provided for in this section, award reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, to the party prevailing on the case as a whole.  Additionally, if the court finds that either party has acted in bad faith solely for the purpose of perpetuating the rate dispute between the parties, the court may impose sanctions on the offending party in accordance with the provisions of Subsections (b), (c), and (e), Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=CP&amp;Value=10.004&amp;Date=6/28/2014">10.004</a>, Civil Practice and Remedies Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  An electric cooperative that has not adopted customer choice and that has not changed each of its nonresidential rates since January 1, 1999, shall, on or before May 1, 2002, adopt a resolution setting rates.
