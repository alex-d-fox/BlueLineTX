GENERAL PROVISIONS</p><br /><p class="left"><a name="39.001"></a><a name="72654.62497"></a></p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Sec. 39.001.  LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND PURPOSE.  (a)  The legislature finds that the production and sale of electricity is not a monopoly warranting regulation of rates, operations, and services and that the public interest in competitive electric markets requires that, except for transmission and distribution services and for the recovery of stranded costs, electric services and their prices should be determined by customer choices and the normal forces of competition.  As a result, this chapter is enacted to protect the public interest during the transition to and in the establishment of a fully competitive electric power industry.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  implement on January 1, 2002, a competitive retail electric market that allows each retail customer to choose the customer's provider of electricity and that encourages full and fair competition among all providers of electricity;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  allow utilities with uneconomic generation-related assets and purchased power contracts to recover the reasonable excess costs over market of those assets and purchased power contracts;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  educate utility customers about anticipated changes in the provision of retail electric service to ensure that the benefits of the competitive market reach all customers;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  protect the competitive process in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of competitively sensitive information during the transition to a competitive market and after the commencement of customer choice.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Regulatory authorities, excluding the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice or the body vested with power to manage and operate a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice, may not make rules or issue orders regulating competitive electric services, prices, or competitors or restricting or conditioning competition except as authorized in this title and may not discriminate against any participant or type of participant during the transition to a competitive market and in the competitive market.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Regulatory authorities, excluding the governing body of a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice or the body vested with power to manage and operate a municipally owned electric utility that has not opted for customer choice, shall authorize or order competitive rather than regulatory methods to achieve the goals of this chapter to the greatest extent feasible and shall adopt rules and issue orders that are both practical and limited so as to impose the least impact on competition.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Judicial review of competition rules adopted by the commission shall be conducted under Chapter 2001, Government Code, except as otherwise provided by this chapter.  Judicial review of the validity of competition rules shall be commenced in the Court of Appeals for the Third Court of Appeals District and shall be limited to the commission's rulemaking record.  The rulemaking record consists of:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the notice of the proposed rule;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the comments of all interested persons;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  all studies, reports, memoranda, or other materials on which the commission relied in adopting the rule;  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  the order adopting the rule.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  A person who challenges the validity of a competition rule must file a notice of appeal with the court of appeals and serve the notice on the commission not later than the 15th day after the date on which the rule as adopted is published in the Texas Register.  The notice of appeal shall designate the person challenging the rule as the appellant and the commission as the appellee.  The commission shall prepare the rulemaking record and file it with the court of appeals not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of appeal is served on the commission.  The court of appeals shall hear and determine each appeal as expeditiously as possible with lawful precedence over other matters.  The appellant, and any person who is permitted by the court to intervene in support of the appellant's claims, shall file and serve briefs not later than the 30th day after the date the commission files the rulemaking record.  The commission, and any person who is permitted by the court to intervene in support of the rule, shall file and serve briefs not later than the 60th day after the date the appellant files the appellant's brief.  The court of appeals may, on its own motion or on motion of any person for good cause, modify the filing deadlines prescribed by this subsection.  The court of appeals shall render judgment affirming the rule or reversing and, if appropriate on reversal, remanding the rule to the commission for further proceedings, consistent with the court's opinion and judgment.  The Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure apply to an appeal brought under this section to the extent not inconsistent with this section.</p>

Within 180 days after the effective date of this section, the commission by rule shall establish the acceptable forms of financial assurance, which shall include, but not be limited to, parent guarantees and support agreements, letters of credit, surety or insurance, and such other requirements necessary to ensure compliance with this section.  In establishing the acceptable forms of assurance, and the eligibility requirements for each form of assurance, the commission shall consider the relative risk factors and creditworthiness attributes of potential applicant financial characteristics in order to minimize exposure of retail electric customers to default by power generation companies under this section.  The power generation company may choose the manner of financial assurance for which it is eligible under the commission's rules.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  In the event the financial assurances provided by Subsection (k) are insufficient to meet the annual funding requirements of the decommissioning trust, the retail electric customers shall be responsible for funding any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning the nuclear generating unit.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  The commission shall determine the manner in which any shortfall in the cost of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit shall be recovered from retail electric customers in the state, consistent with law.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  For retail electric customers of a municipally owned utility or an electric cooperative that has an agreement to purchase power from a nuclear generating unit, the amount of the shortfall in the cost of decommissioning the nuclear generating unit that the customers are responsible for is limited to a portion of that shortfall that bears the same proportion to the total shortfall as the amount of electric power generated by the nuclear generating unit and purchased by the municipally owned utility or electric cooperative bears to the total amount of power the nuclear generating unit generated.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  If retail electric customers in this state become responsible for the costs of decommissioning a nuclear generating unit and incur costs under this section and the nuclear generating unit is operational, as a condition of operating the generating unit, the power generation company or any new owner shall repay the costs the electric customers incurred in the manner determined by the commission.

If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has sold some or all of its generation assets, which sale shall include all generating assets associated with each generating plant that is sold, in a bona fide third-party transaction under a competitive offering, the total net value realized from the sale establishes the market value of the generation assets sold.  If not all assets are sold, the market value of the remaining generation assets shall be established by one or more of the other methods in this section.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  Stock Valuation Method.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the electric utility or power generation company, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, not less than 51 percent of the common stock of each corporation is spun off and sold to public investors through a national stock exchange, and the common stock has been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average daily closing price of the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen by the commission out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the filing required under Subsection (c) establishes the market value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation.  The book value of each transferee corporation's debt and preferred stock securities shall be added to the market value of its assets.  The market value of each transferee corporation's assets shall be reduced by the corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by each transferee corporation from any entity other than the affiliated electric utility or power generation company.  The resulting market value of the assets establishes the market value of the generation assets transferred by the electric utility or power generation company to each separate corporation.  If not all assets are disposed of in this manner, the market value of the remaining assets shall be established by one or more of the other methods in this section.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  Partial Stock Valuation Method.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including, at the election of the electric utility or power generation company, any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, to one or more separate affiliated or nonaffiliated corporations, at least 19 percent, but less than 51 percent, of the common stock of each corporation is spun off and sold to public investors through a national stock exchange, and the common stock has been traded for not less than one year, the resulting average daily closing price of the common stock over 30 consecutive trading days chosen by the commission out of the last 120 consecutive trading days before the filing required under Subsection (c) shall be presumed to establish the market value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation.  The commission may accept the market valuation to conclusively establish the value of the common stock equity in each transferee corporation or convene a valuation panel of three independent financial experts to determine whether the percentage of common stock sold is fairly representative of the total common stock equity or whether a control premium exists for the retained interest.  The valuation panel must consist of financial experts, chosen from proposals submitted in response to commission requests, from the top 10 nationally recognized investment banks with demonstrated experience in the United States electric industry as indicated by the dollar amount of public offerings of long-term debt and equity of United States investor-owned electric companies over the immediately preceding three years as ranked by the publications "Securities Data" or "Institutional Investor."  If the panel determines that a control premium exists for the retained interest, the panel shall determine the amount of the control premium, and the commission shall adopt the determination but may not increase the market value by a control premium greater than 10 percent.  The costs and expenses of the panel, as approved by the commission, shall be paid by each transferee corporation.  The determination of the commission based on the finding of the panel conclusively establishes the value of the common stock of each transferee corporation.  The book value of each transferee corporation's debt and preferred stock securities shall be added to the market value of its assets.  The market value of each transferee corporation's assets shall be reduced by the corresponding net book value of the assets acquired by each transferee corporation from any entity other than the affiliated electric utility or power generation company.  The resulting market value of the assets establishes the market value of the generation assets transferred by the electric utility or power generation company to each separate corporation.</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  Exchange of Assets.  If, at any time after December 31, 1999, an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company has transferred some or all of its generation assets, including any fuel and fuel transportation contracts related to those assets, in a bona fide third-party exchange transaction, the stranded costs related to the transferred assets shall be the difference between the book value and the market value of the transferred assets at the time of the exchange, taking into account any other consideration received or given.  The market value of the transferred assets may be determined through an appraisal by a nationally recognized independent appraisal firm, if the market value is subject to a market valuation by means of an offer of sale in accordance with this subdivision.  To obtain a market valuation by means of an offer of sale, the owner of the asset shall offer it for sale to other parties under procedures that provide broad public notice of the offer and a reasonable opportunity for other parties to bid on the asset.  The owner of the asset may establish a reserve price for any offer based on the sum of the appraised value of the asset and the tax impact of selling the asset, as determined by the commission.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  Unless an electric utility or its affiliated power generation company combines all of its remaining generation assets into one or more transferee corporations as described in Subsections (h)(2) and (3), the electric utility shall quantify its stranded costs for nuclear assets using the ECOM method.  The ECOM method is the estimation model prepared for and described by the commission's April 1998 Report to the Texas Senate Interim Committee on Electric Restructuring entitled "Potentially Strandable Investment (ECOM) Report:  1998 Update."  The methodology used in the model must be the same as that used in the 1998 report to determine the "base case."  At the time of the proceeding under this section, the ECOM model shall be rerun using updated company-specific inputs required by the model, updating the market price of electricity, and using updated natural gas price forecasts and the capacity cost based on the long-run marginal cost of the most economic new generation technology then available.  Natural gas price projections used in the model must be market-based natural gas forward prices, where available.  Growth rates in generating plant operations and maintenance costs and allocated administrative and general costs shall be benchmarked by comparing those costs to the best available information on cost trends for comparable generating plants.  Capital additions shall be benchmarked using the limitation in Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.259&amp;Date=6/28/2014">39.259</a>(b).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The commission shall issue a final order not later than the 150th day after the date of the filing under this section by the transmission and distribution utility, its affiliated retail electric provider, and its affiliated power generation company, and the resulting order shall be subject to judicial review under Chapter 2001, Government Code.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  Notwithstanding Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.252&amp;Date=6/28/2014">39.252</a>, to the extent that a customer's actual load has been lawfully served by a fully operational qualifying facility before September 1, 2001, or by an on-site power production facility with a rated capacity of 10 megawatts or less, any charge for recovery of stranded costs under this section or Subchapter G assessed on that customer after the facility becomes fully operational shall be included only in those tariffs or charges associated with the services actually provided by the transmission and distribution utility, if any, to the customer after the facility became fully operational and may not include any costs associated with the service provided to the customer by the electric utility or its affiliated transmission and distribution utility under their tariffs before the operation of that qualifying facility.  To qualify under this subsection, a qualifying facility must have made substantially complete filings on or before December 31, 1999, for all necessary site-specific environmental permits under the rules of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in effect at the time of filing.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  To protect retail customers in this state, and ensure the appropriateness of the nonbypassable rates of electric utilities and transmission and distribution utilities, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an electric utility or transmission and distribution utility must report to and obtain approval of the commission before closing any transaction in which:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be merged or consolidated with another electric utility or transmission and distribution utility;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  at least 50 percent of the stock of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be transferred or sold; or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a controlling interest or operational control of the electric utility or transmission and distribution utility will be transferred.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  The commission shall approve a transaction under Subsection (l) if the commission finds that the transaction is in the public interest.

The purpose of this subchapter is to enable utilities to use securitization financing to recover regulatory assets, all other amounts determined under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.262&amp;Date=6/28/2014">39.262</a>, and any amounts being recovered under a competition transition charge determined as a result of the proceedings under Sections <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.201&amp;Date=6/28/2014">39.201</a> and <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=39.262&amp;Date=6/28/2014">39.262</a>. This type of debt will lower the carrying costs of the assets relative to the costs that would be incurred using conventional utility financing methods.  The proceeds of the transition bonds shall be used solely for the purposes of reducing the amount of recoverable regulatory assets and other amounts, as determined by the commission in accordance with this chapter, through the refinancing or retirement of utility debt or equity.  The commission shall ensure that securitization provides tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers, greater than would have been achieved absent the issuance of transition bonds.  The commission shall ensure that the structuring and pricing of the transition bonds result in the lowest transition bond charges consistent with market conditions and the terms of the financing order.  The amount securitized may not exceed the present value of the revenue requirement over the life of the proposed transition bond associated with the regulatory assets or other amounts sought to be securitized.  The present value calculation shall use a discount rate equal to the proposed interest rate on the transition bonds.</p>

RECOVERY AND SECURITIZATION OF HURRICANE RECONSTRUCTION COSTS; PURPOSE.  (a)  The purpose of this section and of Sections 39.459-39.463 is to enable an electric utility subject to this subchapter to obtain timely recovery of hurricane reconstruction costs and to use securitization financing to recover these costs, because that type of debt will lower the carrying costs associated with the recovery of hurricane reconstruction costs relative to the costs that would be incurred using conventional financing methods.  The proceeds of the transition bonds may be used only for the purposes of reducing the amount of recoverable hurricane reconstruction costs, as determined by the commission in accordance with this subchapter, through the refinancing or retirement of utility debt or equity.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  It is the intent of the legislature that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs will be subject to the same procedures, standards, and protections for the securitization of stranded costs and regulatory assets under Subchapter G in effect on the effective date of this section, except as provided by this subchapter; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the commission will ensure that securitization of hurricane reconstruction costs provides greater tangible and quantifiable benefits to ratepayers than would have been achieved without the issuance of transition bonds.</p>

(a)  It is the intent of the legislature that by January 1, 2015, an additional 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity from renewable energy technologies will have been installed in this state.  The cumulative installed renewable capacity in this state shall total 5,880 megawatts by January 1, 2015, and the commission shall establish a target of 10,000 megawatts of installed renewable capacity by January 1, 2025.  The cumulative installed renewable capacity in this state shall total 2,280 megawatts by January 1, 2007, 3,272 megawatts by January 1, 2009, 4,264 megawatts by January 1, 2011, 5,256 megawatts by January 1, 2013, and 5,880 megawatts by January 1, 2015.  Of the renewable energy technology generating capacity installed to meet the goal of this subsection after September 1, 2005, the commission shall establish a target of having at least 500 megawatts of capacity from a renewable energy technology other than a source using wind energy.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The commission shall establish a renewable energy credits trading program.  Any retail electric provider, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative that does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection (a) by directly owning or purchasing capacity using renewable energy technologies shall purchase sufficient renewable energy credits to satisfy the requirements by holding renewable energy credits in lieu of capacity from renewable energy technologies.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Not later than January 1, 2000, the commission shall adopt rules necessary to administer and enforce this section.  At a minimum, the rules shall:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  establish the minimum annual renewable energy requirement for each retail electric provider, municipally owned utility, and electric cooperative operating in this state in a manner reasonably calculated by the commission to produce, on a statewide basis, compliance with the requirement prescribed by Subsection (a);  and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  specify reasonable performance standards that all renewable capacity additions must meet to count against the requirement prescribed by Subsection (a) and that:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  are designed and operated so as to maximize the energy output from the capacity additions in accordance with then-current industry standards;  and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  encourage the development, construction, and operation of new renewable energy projects at those sites in this state that have the greatest economic potential for capture and development of this state's environmentally beneficial renewable resources.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  In this section, "renewable energy technology" means any technology that exclusively relies on an energy source that is naturally regenerated over a short time and derived directly from the sun, indirectly from the sun, or from moving water or other natural movements and mechanisms of the environment.  Renewable energy technologies include those that rely on energy derived directly from the sun, on wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, or tidal energy, or on biomass or biomass-based waste products, including landfill gas.  A renewable energy technology does not rely on energy resources derived from fossil fuels, waste products from fossil fuels, or waste products from inorganic sources.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  A municipally owned utility operating a gas distribution system may credit toward satisfaction of the requirements of this section any production or acquisition of landfill gas supplied to the gas distribution system, based on conversion to kilowatt hours of the thermal energy content in British thermal units of the renewable source and using for the conversion factor the annual heat rate of the most efficient gas-fired unit of the combined utility's electric system as measured in British thermal units per kilowatt hour and using the British thermal unit measurement based on the higher heating value measurement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  A municipally owned utility operating a gas distribution system may credit toward satisfaction of the requirements of this section any production or acquisition of landfill gas supplied to the gas distribution system, based on conversion to kilowatt hours of the thermal energy content in British thermal units of the renewable source and using for the conversion factor the systemwide average heat rate of the gas-fired units of the combined utility's electric system as measured in British thermal units per kilowatt hour.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  The commission, after consultation with each appropriate independent organization, electric reliability council, or regional transmission organization:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  shall designate competitive renewable energy zones throughout this state in areas in which renewable energy resources and suitable land areas are sufficient to develop generating capacity from renewable energy technologies;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  shall develop a plan to construct transmission capacity necessary to deliver to electric customers, in a manner that is most beneficial and cost-effective to the customers, the electric output from renewable energy technologies in the competitive renewable energy zones; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  shall consider the level of financial commitment by generators for each competitive renewable energy zone in determining whether to designate an area as a competitive renewable energy zone and whether to grant a certificate of convenience and necessity.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  In considering an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a transmission project intended to serve a competitive renewable energy zone, the commission is not required to consider the factors provided by Sections <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=UT&amp;Value=37.056&amp;Date=6/28/2014">37.056</a>(c)(1) and (2).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  Transmission service to a competitive renewable energy zone must be provided in a manner consistent with Subchapter A, Chapter 35.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  The commission, after consultation with each appropriate independent organization, electric reliability council, or regional transmission organization, shall file a report with the legislature not later than December 31 of each even-numbered year.  The report must include:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  an evaluation of the commission's implementation of competitive renewable energy zones;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the estimated cost of transmission service improvements needed for each competitive renewable energy zone; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  an evaluation of the effects that additional renewable generation has on system reliability and on the cost of alternatives to mitigate the effects.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The commission and the independent organization certified for ERCOT shall study the need for increased transmission and generation capacity throughout this state and report to the legislature the results of the study and any recommendations for legislation.

The commission shall exclude from the calculation of a retail electric provider's, municipally owned utility's, or electric cooperative's requirement under Subsection (c)(1) energy sold by the retail electric provider, municipally owned utility, or electric cooperative at transmission-level voltage to customers who have submitted the notice to the commission under this subsection for the applicable year.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m-2)  The commission shall determine the reporting requirements and schedule necessary to implement Subsections (m) and (m-1).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m-3)  Subsections (m), (m-1), and (m-2) do not alter the renewable energy goals or targets established in Subsection (a) or reduce the minimum statewide renewable energy requirements of Subsection (c)(1).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission shall have the authority to cap the price of renewable energy credits and may suspend the goal contained in Subsection (a) if such suspension is necessary to protect the reliability and operation of the grid.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  The commission may establish an alternative compliance payment.  An entity that has a renewable energy purchase requirement under this section may elect to pay the alternative compliance payment instead of applying renewable energy credits toward the satisfaction of the entity's obligation under this section.  The commission may establish a separate alternative compliance payment for the goal of 500 megawatts of capacity from renewable energy technologies other than wind energy.  The alternative compliance payment for a renewable energy purchase requirement that could be satisfied with a renewable energy credit from wind energy may not be less than $2.50 per credit or greater than $20 per credit.  Prior to September 1, 2009, an alternative compliance payment under this subsection may not be set above $5 per credit.  In implementing this subsection, the commission shall consider:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the effect of renewable energy credit prices on retail competition;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the effect of renewable energy credit prices on electric rates;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  the effect of the alternative compliance payment level on the renewable energy credit market; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  any other factors necessary to ensure the continued development of the renewable energy industry in this state while protecting ratepayers from unnecessary rate increases.</p>
