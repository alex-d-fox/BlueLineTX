(a)  The appraisal district is governed by a board of directors.  Five directors are appointed by the taxing units that participate in the district as provided by this section.  If the county assessor-collector is not appointed to the board, the county assessor-collector serves as a nonvoting director.  The county assessor-collector is ineligible to serve if the board enters into a contract under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=6.05&amp;Date=6/26/2014">6.05</a>(b) or if the commissioners court of the county enters into a contract under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=6.24&amp;Date=6/26/2014">6.24</a>(b).  To be eligible to serve on the board of directors, an individual other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director must be a resident of the district and must have resided in the district for at least two years immediately preceding the date the individual takes office.  An individual who is otherwise eligible to serve on the board is not ineligible because of membership on the governing body of a taxing unit.  An employee of a taxing unit that participates in the district is not eligible to serve on the board unless the individual is also a member of the governing body or an elected official of a taxing unit that participates in the district.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  Members of the board of directors other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director serve two-year terms beginning on January 1 of even-numbered years.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  Members of the board of directors other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director are appointed by vote of the governing bodies of the incorporated cities and towns, the school districts, the junior college districts, and, if entitled to vote, the conservation and reclamation districts that participate in the district and of the county.  A governing body may cast all its votes for one candidate or distribute them among candidates for any number of directorships.  Conservation and reclamation districts are not entitled to vote unless at least one conservation and reclamation district in the district delivers to the chief appraiser a written request to nominate and vote on the board of directors by June 1 of each odd-numbered year.  On receipt of a request, the chief appraiser shall certify a list by June 15 of all eligible conservation and reclamation districts that are imposing taxes and that participate in the district.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The voting entitlement of a taxing unit that is entitled to vote for directors is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year by the sum of the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district for that year by each taxing unit that is entitled to vote, by multiplying the quotient by 1,000, and by rounding the product to the nearest whole number.  That number is multiplied by the number of directorships to be filled. A taxing unit participating in two or more districts is entitled to vote in each district in which it participates, but only the taxes imposed in a district are used to calculate voting entitlement in that district.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  The chief appraiser shall calculate the number of votes to which each taxing unit other than a conservation and reclamation district is entitled and shall deliver written notice to each of those units of its voting entitlement before October 1 of each odd-numbered year.  The chief appraiser shall deliver the notice:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  to the county judge and each commissioner of the county served by the appraisal district;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each city or town participating in the appraisal district, to the city manager of each city or town having a city manager, and to the city secretary or clerk, if there is one, of each city or town that does not have a city manager;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each school district participating in the district and to the superintendent of those school districts; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each junior college district participating in the district and to the president, chancellor, or other chief executive officer of those junior college districts.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  The chief appraiser shall calculate the number of votes to which each conservation and reclamation district entitled to vote for district directors is entitled and shall deliver written notice to the presiding officer of each conservation and reclamation district of its voting entitlement and right to nominate a person to serve as a director of the district before July 1 of each odd-numbered year.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  Each taxing unit other than a conservation and reclamation district that is entitled to vote may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body one candidate for each position to be filled on the board of directors.  The presiding officer of the governing body of the unit shall submit the names of the unit's nominees to the chief appraiser before October 15.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  Each conservation and reclamation district entitled to vote may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body one candidate for the district's board of directors.  The presiding officer of the conservation and reclamation district's governing body shall submit the name of the district's nominee to the chief appraiser before July 15 of each odd-numbered year.  Before August 1, the chief appraiser shall prepare a nominating ballot, listing all the nominees of conservation and reclamation districts alphabetically by surname, and shall deliver a copy of the nominating ballot to the presiding officer of the board of directors of each district.  The board of directors of each district shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser before August 15.  The nominee on the ballot with the most votes is the nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district if the nominee received more than 10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast by all of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district, and shall be named on the ballot with the candidates nominated by the other taxing units.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If no nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts receives more than 10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast under Subsection (h), the chief appraiser, before September 1, shall notify the presiding officer of the board of directors of each conservation and reclamation district of the failure to select a nominee.  Each conservation and reclamation district may submit a nominee by September 15 to the chief appraiser as provided by Subsection (h).  The chief appraiser shall submit a second nominating ballot by October 1 to the conservation and reclamation districts as provided by Subsection (h).  The conservation and reclamation districts shall submit their votes for nomination before October 15 as provided by Subsection (h).  The nominee on the second nominating ballot with the most votes is the nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district and shall be named on the ballot with the candidates nominated by the other taxing units.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  Before October 30, the chief appraiser shall prepare a ballot, listing the candidates whose names were timely submitted under Subsections (g) and, if applicable, (h) or (i) alphabetically according to the first letter in each candidate's surname, and shall deliver a copy of the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit that is entitled to vote.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  The governing body of each taxing unit entitled to vote shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser before December 15.  The chief appraiser shall count the votes, declare the five candidates who receive the largest cumulative vote totals elected, and submit the results before December 31 to the governing body of each taxing unit in the district and to the candidates.  For purposes of determining the number of votes received by the candidates, the candidate receiving the most votes of the conservation and reclamation districts is considered to have received all of the votes cast by conservation and reclamation districts and the other candidates are considered not to have received any votes of the conservation and reclamation districts.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors other than a vacancy in the position held by a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director, each taxing unit that is entitled to vote by this section may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body a candidate to fill the vacancy.  The unit shall submit the name of its nominee to the chief appraiser within 45 days after notification from the board of directors of the existence of the vacancy, and the chief appraiser shall prepare and deliver to the board of directors within the next five days a list of the nominees.  The board of directors shall elect by majority vote of its members one of the nominees to fill the vacancy.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  Repealed by Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 648, Sec. 5(4), eff.

A change to staggered terms may be adopted only if the method or procedure for appointing board members is changed under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=6.031&amp;Date=6/26/2014">6.031</a> of this code to eliminate or have the effect of eliminating cumulative voting for board members as provided by Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=6.03&amp;Date=6/26/2014">6.03</a> of this code.

Before October 10 the chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of a change that is adopted under this section.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  A change to staggered terms made under this section becomes effective beginning on January 1 of the next even-numbered year after the chief appraiser determines that the change has been adopted.  The entire board of directors shall be appointed for that year without regard to the staggered terms.  At the earliest practical date after January 1 of that year, the board shall determine by lot which of its members shall serve one-year terms and which shall serve two-year terms in order to implement the staggered terms.  If the board consists of an even number of board members, one-half of the members must be designated to serve one-year terms and one-half shall be designated to serve two-year terms.

The change may not provide that the number of members whose terms are to begin in even-numbered years differs by more than one from the number of members whose terms are to begin in odd-numbered years.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  A change to staggered terms made as provided by this section may be rescinded by resolution of a majority of the governing bodies that are entitled to vote on appointment of board members under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=6.03&amp;Date=6/26/2014">6.03</a> of this code.  To be effective, a resolution providing for the rescission must be adopted by the governing body and filed with the chief appraiser after June 30 and before October 1 of an odd-numbered year.  If the required number of resolutions are filed during that period, the chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district that the rescission is adopted.  If the rescission is adopted, the terms of all members of the board serving at the time of the adoption expire on January 1 of the even-numbered year following the adoption, including terms of members who will have served only one year of a two-year term on that date.

(a)  Each year the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed budget for the operations of the district for the following tax year and shall submit copies to each taxing unit participating in the district and to the district board of directors before June 15.  He shall include in the budget a list showing each proposed position, the proposed salary for the position, all benefits proposed for the position, each proposed capital expenditure, and an estimate of the amount of the budget that will be allocated to each taxing unit.  Each taxing unit entitled to vote on the appointment of board members shall maintain a copy of the proposed budget for public inspection at its principal administrative office.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The board of directors shall hold a public hearing to consider the budget.  The secretary of the board shall deliver to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in the district not later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing a written notice of the date, time, and place fixed for the hearing.  The board shall complete its hearings, make any amendments to the proposed budget it desires, and finally approve a budget before September 15.  If governing bodies of a majority of the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions disapproving a budget and file them with the secretary of the board within 30 days after its adoption, the budget does not take effect, and the board shall adopt a new budget within 30 days of the disapproval.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  The board may amend the approved budget at any time, but the secretary of the board must deliver a written copy of a proposed amendment to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in the district not later than the 30th day before the date the board acts on it.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  Each taxing unit participating in the district is allocated a portion of the amount of the budget equal to the proportion that the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by the unit for the tax year in which the budget proposal is prepared bears to the sum of the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by each participating unit for that year.  If a taxing unit participates in two or more districts, only the taxes imposed in a district are used to calculate the unit's cost allocations in that district.  If the number of real property parcels in a taxing unit is less than 5 percent of the total number of real property parcels in the district and the taxing unit imposes in excess of 25 percent of the total amount of the property taxes imposed in the district by all of the participating taxing units for a year, the unit's allocation may not exceed a percentage of the appraisal district's budget equal to three times the unit's percentage of the total number of real property parcels appraised by the district.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  Unless the governing body of a unit and the chief appraiser agree to a different method of payment, each taxing unit shall pay its allocation in four equal payments to be made at the end of each calendar quarter, and the first payment shall be made before January 1 of the year in which the budget takes effect.  A payment is delinquent if not paid on the date it is due.  A delinquent payment incurs a penalty of 5 percent of the amount of the payment and accrues interest at an annual rate of 10 percent.  If the budget is amended, any change in the amount of a unit's allocation is apportioned among the payments remaining.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(f)  Payments shall be made to a depository designated by the district board of directors.  The district's funds may be disbursed only by a written check, draft, or order signed by the chairman and secretary of the board or, if authorized by resolution of the board, by the chief appraiser.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(g)  If a taxing unit decides not to impose taxes for any tax year, the unit is not liable for any of the costs of operating the district in that year, and those costs are allocated among the other taxing units as if that unit had not imposed taxes in the year used to calculate allocations.  However, if that unit has made any payments, it is not entitled to a refund.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(h)  If a newly formed taxing unit or a taxing unit that did not impose taxes in the preceding year imposes taxes in any tax year, that unit is allocated a portion of the amount budgeted to operate the district as if it had imposed taxes in the preceding year, except that the amount of taxes the unit imposes in the current year is used to calculate its allocation.  Before the amount of taxes to be imposed for the current year is known, the allocation may be based on an estimate to which the district board of directors and the governing body of the unit agree, and the payments made after that amount is known shall be adjusted to reflect the amount imposed.  The payments of a newly formed taxing unit that has no source of funds are postponed until the unit has received adequate tax or other revenues.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  The fiscal year of an appraisal district is the calendar year unless the governing bodies of three-fourths of the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions proposing a different fiscal year and file them with the secretary of the board not more than 12 and not less than eight months before the first day of the fiscal year proposed by the resolutions.  If the fiscal year of an appraisal district is changed under this subsection, the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed budget for the fiscal year as provided by Subsection (a) of this section before the 15th day of the seventh month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established by the change, and the board of directors shall adopt a budget for the fiscal year as provided by Subsection (b) of this section before the 15th day of the fourth month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established by the change.  Unless the appraisal district adopts a different method of allocation under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=TX&amp;Value=6.061&amp;Date=6/26/2014">6.061</a> of this code, the allocation of the budget to each taxing unit shall be calculated as provided by Subsection (d) of this section using the amount of property taxes imposed by each participating taxing unit in the most recent tax year preceding the fiscal year established by the change for which the necessary information is available.  Each taxing unit shall pay its allocation as provided by Subsection (e) of this section, except that the first payment shall be made before the first day of the fiscal year established by the change and subsequent payments shall be made quarterly.  In the year in which a change in the fiscal year occurs, the budget that takes effect on January 1 of that year may be amended as necessary as provided by Subsection (c) of this section in order to accomplish the change in fiscal years.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(j)  If the total amount of the payments made or due to be made by the taxing units participating in an appraisal district exceeds the amount actually spent or obligated to be spent during the fiscal year for which the payments were made, the chief appraiser shall credit the excess amount against each taxing unit's allocated payments for the following year in proportion to the amount of each unit's budget allocation for the fiscal year for which the payments were made.  If a taxing unit that paid its allocated amount is not allocated a portion of the district's budget for the following fiscal year, the chief appraiser shall refund to the taxing unit its proportionate share of the excess funds not later than the 150th day after the end of the fiscal year for which the payments were made.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(k)  For good cause shown, the board of directors may waive the penalty and interest on a delinquent payment under Subsection (e).</p>
