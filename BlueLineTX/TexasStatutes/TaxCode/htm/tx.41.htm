In addition and without limitation as to the number of postponements, the board shall postpone the hearing to a later date if the property owner or the owner's agent at any time shows good cause for the postponement or if the chief appraiser consents to the postponement.  The hearing may not be postponed to a date less than five or more than 30 days after the date scheduled for the hearing when the postponement is sought unless the date and time of the hearing as postponed are agreed to by the chairman of the appraisal review board or the chairman's representative, the property owner, and the chief appraiser.  A request by a property owner for a postponement under this subsection may be made in writing, including by facsimile transmission or electronic mail, by telephone, or in person to the appraisal review board, a panel of the board, or the chairman of the board.

Each appraisal district shall make copies of the affidavit form available to property owners without charge.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l)  A property owner is not required to use the affidavit form prescribed by the comptroller when offering an affidavit under Subsection (b).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  If the protest relates to a taxable leasehold or other possessory interest in real property that is owned by this state or a political subdivision of this state, the attorney general or a representative of the state agency that owns the land, if the real property is owned by this state, or a person designated by the political subdivision that owns the real property, as applicable, is entitled to appear at the hearing and offer evidence and argument.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  A property owner does not waive the right to appear in person at the protest hearing by submitting an affidavit to the appraisal review board.  The board may consider the affidavit only if the property owner does not appear at the protest hearing in person.  For purposes of scheduling the hearing, the property owner shall state in the affidavit that the property owner does not intend to appear at the hearing or that the property owner intends to appear at the hearing and that the affidavit may be used only if the property owner does not appear at the hearing.  If the property owner does not state in the affidavit whether the owner intends to appear at the hearing, the board shall consider the submission of the affidavit as an indication that the property owner does not intend to appear at the hearing.  If the property owner states in the affidavit that the owner does not intend to appear at the hearing or does not state in the affidavit whether the owner intends to appear at the hearing, the appraisal review board is not required to consider the affidavit at the scheduled hearing and may consider the affidavit at a hearing designated for the specific purpose of processing affidavits.</p>
