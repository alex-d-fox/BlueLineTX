The legislature finds that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  many states have enacted aggressive economic development laws designed to attract large employers, create jobs, and strengthen their economies;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  given Texas' relatively high ad valorem taxes, it is difficult for the state to compete for new capital projects without temporarily limiting ad valorem taxes imposed on new capital investments;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  a significant portion of the Texas economy continues to be based in manufacturing and other capital-intensive industries, and their continued growth and overall health serve the Texas economy well;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  without a vibrant, strong manufacturing sector, other sectors of the economy, especially the state's service sector, will also suffer adverse consequences; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  the current ad valorem tax system of this state does not favor capital-intensive businesses such as manufacturers.</p>
