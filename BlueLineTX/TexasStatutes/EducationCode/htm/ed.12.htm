(a)  The commissioner shall develop and by rule adopt a procedure for renewal, denial of renewal, or expiration of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school at the end of the term of the charter.  The procedure must include consideration of the performance under Chapter 39 of the charter holder and each campus operating under the charter and must include three distinct processes, which must be expedited renewal, discretionary consideration of renewal or denial of renewal, and expiration.  To renew a charter at the end of the term, the charter holder must submit a petition for renewal to the commissioner in the time and manner established by commissioner rule.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  At the end of the term of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school, if a charter holder submits to the commissioner a petition for expedited renewal of the charter, the charter automatically renews unless, not later than the 30th day after the date the charter holder submits the petition, the commissioner provides written notice to the charter holder that expedited renewal of the charter is denied.  The commissioner may not deny expedited renewal of a charter if:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the charter holder has been assigned the highest or second highest performance rating under Subchapter C, Chapter 39, for the three preceding school years;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  the charter holder has been assigned a financial performance accountability rating under Subchapter D, Chapter 39, indicating financial performance that is satisfactory or better for the three preceding school years; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  no campus operating under the charter has been assigned the lowest performance rating under Subchapter C, Chapter 39, for the three preceding school years or such a campus has been closed.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c)  At the end of the term of a charter for an open-enrollment charter school, if a charter holder submits to the commissioner a petition for renewal of the charter and the charter does not meet the criteria for expedited renewal under Subsection (b) or for expiration under Subsection (d), the commissioner shall use the discretionary consideration process.  The commissioner's decision under the discretionary consideration process must take into consideration the results of annual evaluations under the performance frameworks established under Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=ED&amp;Value=12.1181&amp;Date=6/28/2014">12.1181</a>.  The renewal of the charter of an open-enrollment charter school that is registered under the agency's alternative education accountability procedures for evaluation under Chapter 39 shall be considered under the discretionary consideration process regardless of the performance ratings under Subchapter C, Chapter 39, of the open-enrollment charter school or of any campus operating under the charter, except that if the charter holder has been assigned a financial accountability performance rating under Subchapter D, Chapter 39, indicating financial performance that is lower than satisfactory for any three of the five preceding school years, the commissioner shall allow the charter to expire under Subsection (d).  In considering the renewal of the charter of an open-enrollment charter school that is registered under the agency's alternative education accountability procedures for evaluation under Chapter 39, such as a dropout recovery school or a school providing education within a residential treatment facility, the commissioner shall use academic criteria established by commissioner rule that are appropriate to measure the specific goals of the school.  The criteria established by the commissioner shall recognize growth in student achievement as well as educational attainment.

For purposes of determination of renewal under Subsection (b)(1) or (3) or (d)(1) or (4), the initial three school years for which performance ratings under Subchapter C, Chapter 39, shall be considered are the 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2012-2013 school years.  For purposes of determination of renewal under Subsection (b)(2) or (d)(2), the earliest school year for which financial accountability performance ratings under Subchapter D, Chapter 39, may be considered is the 2010-2011 school year.
