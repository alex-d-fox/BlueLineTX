English is the basic language of this state.  Public schools are responsible for providing a full opportunity for all students to become competent in speaking, reading, writing, and comprehending the English language.  Large numbers of students in the state come from environments in which the primary language is other than English.  Experience has shown that public school classes in which instruction is given only in English are often inadequate for the education of those students.  The mastery of basic English language skills is a prerequisite for effective participation in the state's educational program.  Bilingual education and special language programs can meet the needs of those students and facilitate their integration into the regular school curriculum.  Therefore, in accordance with the policy of the state to ensure equal educational opportunity to every student, and in recognition of the educational needs of students of limited English proficiency, this subchapter provides for the establishment of bilingual education and special language programs in the public schools and provides supplemental financial assistance to help school districts meet the extra costs of the programs.</p>

(a)  The legislature finds that it is essential for the well-being and growth of students who are deaf or hard of hearing that educational programs recognize the unique nature of deafness and the hard-of-hearing condition and ensure that all students who are deaf or hard of hearing have appropriate, ongoing, and fully accessible educational opportunities.  Students who are deaf or hard of hearing may choose to use a variety of language modes and languages, including oral and manual-visual language.  Students who are deaf may choose to communicate through the language of the deaf community, American Sign Language, or through any of a number of English-based manual-visual languages.  Students who are hard of hearing may choose to use spoken and written English, including speech reading or lip reading, together with amplification instruments, such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, or assistive listening systems, to communicate with the hearing population.  Students who are deaf or hard of hearing may choose to use a combination of oral or manual-visual language systems, including cued speech, manual signed systems, and American Sign Language, or may rely exclusively on the oral-aural language of their choice.  Students who are deaf or hard of hearing also may use other technologies to enhance language learning.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(b)  The legislature recognizes that students who are deaf or hard of hearing should have the opportunity to develop proficiency in English, including oral or manual-visual methods of communication, and American Sign Language.</p>
