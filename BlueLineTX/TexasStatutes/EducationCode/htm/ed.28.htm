As a condition of accreditation, the board shall require each district to provide instruction in the essential knowledge and skills at appropriate grade levels and to make available to each high school student in the district an Algebra II course.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c-1)  The State Board of Education shall adopt rules requiring students enrolled in grade levels six, seven, and eight to complete at least one fine arts course during those grade levels as part of a district's fine arts curriculum.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(c-2)  Each time the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board revises the Internet database of the coordinating board's official statewide inventory of workforce education courses, the State Board of Education shall by rule revise the essential knowledge and skills of any corresponding career and technology education curriculum as provided by Subsection (c).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(d)  The physical education curriculum required under Subsection (a)(2)(C) must be sequential, developmentally appropriate, and designed, implemented, and evaluated to enable students to develop the motor, self-management, and other skills, knowledge, attitudes, and confidence necessary to participate in physical activity throughout life.  Each school district shall establish specific objectives and goals the district intends to accomplish through the physical education curriculum.  In identifying the essential knowledge and skills of physical education, the State Board of Education shall ensure that the curriculum:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  emphasizes the knowledge and skills capable of being used during a lifetime of regular physical activity;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  is consistent with national physical education standards for:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  the information that students should learn about physical activity; and</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  the physical activities that students should be able to perform;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(3)  requires that, on a weekly basis, at least 50 percent of the physical education class be used for actual student physical activity and that the activity be, to the extent practicable, at a moderate or vigorous level;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(4)  offers students an opportunity to choose among many types of physical activity in which to participate;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(5)  offers students both cooperative and competitive games;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(6)  meets the needs of students of all physical ability levels, including students who have a disability, chronic health problem, or other special need that precludes the student from participating in regular physical education instruction but who might be able to participate in physical education that is suitably adapted and, if applicable, included in the student's individualized education program;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(7)  takes into account the effect that gender and cultural differences might have on the degree of student interest in physical activity or on the types of physical activity in which a student is interested;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(8)  teaches self-management and movement skills;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(9)  teaches cooperation, fair play, and responsible participation in physical activity;</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(10)  promotes student participation in physical activity outside of school; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(11)  allows physical education classes to be an enjoyable experience for students.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(e)  American Sign Language is a language for purposes of Subsection (a)(2)(A).

To the extent practicable, a school district shall require a student enrolled in prekindergarten on less than a full-day basis to participate in the same type and amount of physical activity as a student enrolled in full-day prekindergarten.  A school district shall require students enrolled in grade levels six, seven, and eight to participate in moderate or vigorous daily physical activity for at least 30 minutes for at least four semesters during those grade levels as part of the district's physical education curriculum.  If a school district determines, for any particular grade level below grade six, that requiring moderate or vigorous daily physical activity is impractical due to scheduling concerns or other factors, the district may as an alternative require a student in that grade level to participate in moderate or vigorous physical activity for at least 135 minutes during each school week.  Additionally, a school district may as an alternative require a student enrolled in a grade level for which the district uses block scheduling to participate in moderate or vigorous physical activity for at least 225 minutes during each period of two school weeks.  A school district must provide for an exemption for:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  any student who is unable to participate in the required physical activity because of illness or disability; and</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  a middle school or junior high school student who participates in an extracurricular activity with a moderate or vigorous physical activity component that is considered a structured activity under rules adopted by the commissioner.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l-1)  In adopting rules relating to an activity described by Subsection (l)(2), the commissioner may permit an exemption for a student who participates in a school-related activity or an activity sponsored by a private league or club only if the student provides proof of participation in the activity.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l-2)  To encourage school districts to promote physical activity for children through classroom curricula for health and physical education, the agency, in consultation with the Department of State Health Services, shall designate nationally recognized health and physical education program guidelines that a school district may use in the health curriculum under Subsection (a)(2)(B) or the physical education curriculum under Subsection (a)(2)(C).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(l-3)(1)  This subsection may be cited as "Lauren's Law."</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  The State Board of Education, the Department of State Health Services, or a school district may not adopt any rule, policy, or program under Subsections (a), (k), (l), (l-1), or (l-2) that would prohibit a parent or grandparent of a student from providing any food product of the parent's or grandparent's choice to:</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(A)  children in the classroom of the child of the parent or grandparent on the occasion of the child's birthday; or</p><p style="text-indent:19ex;" class="left">(B)  children at a school-designated function.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(m)  Section <a target="new" href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us//GetStatute.aspx?Code=GV&amp;Value=2001.039&amp;Date=6/28/2014">2001.039</a>, Government Code, as added by Chapter 1499, Acts of the 76th Legislature, Regular Session, 1999, does not apply to a rule adopted by the State Board of Education under Subsection (c) or (d).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(n)  The State Board of Education may by rule develop and implement a plan designed to incorporate foundation curriculum requirements into the career and technology education curriculum under Subsection (a)(2)(E).</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(o)  In approving career and technology courses, the State Board of Education must determine that at least 50 percent of the approved courses are cost-effective for a school district to implement.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(p)  The State Board of Education, in conjunction with the office of the attorney general, shall develop a parenting and paternity awareness program that a school district shall use in the district's high school health curriculum.

At the discretion of the district, a teacher may modify the suggested sequence and pace of the program at any grade level.
