In a response dated September 6, 2013, Deborah S. Delisle, Assistant Secretary of Education, wrote in part:</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">Section 9401 of the ESEA authorizes the Secretary to grant a waiver of most provisions of the ESEA if the waiver would increase the quality of instruction and improve the academic achievement of students.  Secretary Duncan has delegated authority for waivers to me and, thus, I have reviewed the request.  After careful review of the provided information in your letter, our team has determined that a waiver of the ESEA provisions requiring the annual assessment of students in grades 3 through 8 do not meet the statutory threshold for approval.  Annual assessment of all students in grades 3 through 8 is critical to holding schools and LEAs [local education authorities] accountable for improving the achievement of all students and to providing transparency on LEA, school, and student performance to families, communities, and other stakeholders.  Therefore, should the TEA submit such a request, I would decline to exercise my authority to grant a waiver of the provisions you have identified.</p>
